        <p>I have been training with Chaitanya for the past 2 months now. For 
            the record, I hated yoga before I joined my training with him and 
            today, in two months he has made me fall in love with yoga! I 
            genuinely enjoy my sessions with him and I look forward to training 
            with him in the morning. He is extremely adjusting, amazing with his
            work, pinpointing at every mistake, and by far the most encouraging
            trainer! In the last 2 months, I have seen so much change, in spite 
            of having a weak wrist I can do Surya Namaskar without any pain, 
            just by following his instructions! I have never enjoyed yoga as 
            much as I enjoy it with him! He is the best trainer I have had and 
            anyone who trains under him is going to be very lucky and see 
            amazing results!</p>

                <p>I have been dancing for about 19 years with an average 4-5 
                    hours of dancing in a day. Due to my cardio routine and not
                    having enough protein in my diet, I was unable to gain 
                    weight. I came across Fitternityâ€™s profile on Instagram and 
                    decided to go ahead with personal training. They right away 
                    allotted me a trainer, Shwan, with whom I have been 
                    training for 45 days. My achievements so far have been to 
                    gain 3.5 kgs in just 45 days! My trainer helped me in 
                    gaining weight as well as improving my flexibility and 
                    stamina and most importantly I feel more confident! I would 
                    definitely recommend Fitternity for anyone who wants to lose
                    or gain weight as they have the most supportive and positive
                    team. If you have the drive, will, and determination, 
                    nothing is impossible.</p>
